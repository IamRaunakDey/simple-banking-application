The Simple Banking System (SBA) is a basic Java application designed to simulate basic banking operations through a graphical user interface. This project provides a secure login mechanism for users to access their accounts using an account number and password. Once logged in, users can perform essential banking functions such as depositing funds, withdrawing money, and checking their current balance. Built using Java Swing, the application demonstrates fundamental concepts like event handling, GUI design, and basic authentication.
